Welcome to Pardella Renewed!

Things before you get into it:

1 - Make sure your anti-virus is off.

2 - Extract ZIP Folder and drag folders inside of the extracted folde to the main folder where the exe is located

3 - Updating is automoatic with the DLL. If your connection is slow, Pardella will take longer to open.

Have fun!
